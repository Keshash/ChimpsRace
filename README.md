# ChimpsRace
Chimpanzee race for Rimworld. Made from "RimRaces - Cruttun Race" and "[B18] RimWorld of the Apes Mod 3.0" mods. I claim no ownership to those the parts of the mod, this is just a trimmed down merge of both.

Feature:
* Human-like chimpanzee race. They can use weapons and apparel just like normal colonists.
* They are worse at trading and fighting than humans (see race defs)
* They are faster than humans
* They have less weight/bulk capacity and parry worse than humans in CE.

Big chunk of the art was manually redone and upscaled. Skin colors were changed to more tame, muted ones.
